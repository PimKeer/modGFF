# modGFF
This is a very small overview of the main functions in this repository. For their workings, we would recommend to look at the thesis.

In cg.py, the CG sampler functions for the GFF are written.

In cluster.py, the cluster finding algorithm can be found.

In genGFFChafai.py and genGFFSheffield.py, the GFF generators using Chafai's and Sheffield's methods respectively are written. 

The file conductances.py contains the function to generate a checkerboard pattern with n=5 (and N a multiple of 10).

matrices.py contains all the used precision matrices (or rather matrix-vector product functions).

In the main_.py scripts, the simulations described in the paper can be found.

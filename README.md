# modGFF

In cg.py, the CG sampler functions for the GFF are written.

In cluster.py, the cluster finding algorithm can be found.

In genGFFChafai.py and genGFFSheffield.py, the GFF generators using Chafai's and Sheffield's methods respectively are written. Note that Chafai is really slow the way it is now and so it isn't that useful.

In gibbs.py, a Gibbs sampler for the GFF is given.

matrices.py contains all the used precision matrices (or rather matrix-vector product functions).

In percolation.py, the Marinov-Lebowitz method is worked out.
